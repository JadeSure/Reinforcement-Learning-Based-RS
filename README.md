# Reinforcement-Learning-Based-RS

This is the code reproduction for a paper: Reinforcement Learning based RS using Biclustering Technique. [paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05532) It use a few techniques including data processing(pandas, numpy), biclustering algorithm (in the matlab), Q-learning (SARSA needs a little code change) and also data visulization with turtle and grid.

Unfortunately, the code reproduction is not success because too many details are not mentioned in the paper. It also includes a few theory flaws. For instance, there is no reason Unfortunately, the code reproduction is not a success because too many details are not mentioned in the paper. It also includes a few theory flaws. For instance, there is no reason why they map clusters into the grid by what manner, and how they do this. Thus, Q-learning is not convergency.
